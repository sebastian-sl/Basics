# Basics

This repository will serve as a Cheat Sheet or storage of Code Snippets for my most used Programming Languages (Java, Python, Javascript) and other important things aswell (GIT, HTML, CSS etc.). So i can come back to this public repo everytime i need to look for some code snippet or see how certain Frameworks work.  

&nbsp;

The repository will be divided by topics and will probably contain the nine following folders:

* **[00 Basics:](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/00%20BASICS)** Classes, Datatypes and Basic Methods
* **[01 Data Science:](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/01%20DATA%20SCIENCE/PANDAS)** Pandas, Excel Manipulation, Numpy, Visualisation and Sklearn
* **[02 Databases:](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/02%20DATABASES)** Connection Snippets, ORM with basic CRUD (MySQL, Postgres, MS-SQLConnection)
* **[03 CLI](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/03%20CLI)** Command-line instructions
* **[04 File Management:](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/04%20FILE%20MANAGEMENT)** Basic CRUD Operations for .txt/.csv
* **[05 Requests:](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/05%20REQUESTS)** Basic API calls and Webscraping
* **[06 GIT](https://github.com/sebastian-sl/Basics/tree/main/06%20GIT)**

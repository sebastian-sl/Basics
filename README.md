# Basics

This repository will serve as a Cheat Sheet or Storage of Basic Code for my most used Programming Languages (Java, Python, Javascript) and other important things aswell (GIT, HTML, CSS etc.). So i can come back to this public repo everytime i need to look for some code snippet or see how certain Frameworks work.  

&nbsp;

The repository will be divided by topics and will probably contain the nine following folders:

* **Basics:** Classes, Datatypes and Basic Methods
* **Data Science:** Pandas, Numpy, Visualisation and Sklearn
* **Databases**
* **CLI**
* **File Management:** CSV, txt, Excel
* **Requests:** Webscraping
* **GIT**
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS + Frameworks, Javascript + Frameworks
* **Backend:** Django, Flask, Spring, Express
* **Others**  

&nbsp;

*This repository probably won't be perfect, since i'm not an expert but i will try to maintain best practices and modern code*

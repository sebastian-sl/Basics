## Basics
In this Section, i wil only write down snippets of the most core/basic things for every programming language like classes, datatypes and methods. This section won't go into detail about everything since that would be too much. Some datatypes (like int, float, bool, bytes, sets) and not preferably used methods (like recursion) won't be covered.

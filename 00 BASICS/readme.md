## Basics
In this Basics section, i will showcase some of the more basic things like Classes, Datatypes and built-in methods. I won't go into detail
about everything since that would be too much. For example i will leave out some easier datatypes (like int, float, bool) as well as not
really frequently used datatypes (bytes, sets - at least i barely use them) or not really preferably used methods (i.e recursion).

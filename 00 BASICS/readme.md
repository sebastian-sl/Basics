## Basics
In this Basics we will discuss datatypes and some basic methods of every programming language. I won't go into detail about every 
datatype since that would be too much. I will leave out some of the easier datatypes (like int, float, booleans) aswell as not 
really frequently used ones (like bytes, sets - at least i barely use them).

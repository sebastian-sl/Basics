# Plotly

Plotly is a data visualization libray which can be used for free. It has a relatively easy syntax im comparison to other libaries and is perfect to get up some graphs/charts fast. Another big advantage in comparison to matplotlib for example, is that you can create interactive charts out of the box. You can easily create sliders, zoom in and have hover options available.

There are two ways to create plotly charts. Both will be displayed in the code snippets in each folder:

* **Graph Objects** This is the 'standard' way of creating graphs within plotly. The syntax will be a bit 'heaver' and longer. Graph Objects are ideally if you want to built highly customized charts

* **Plotly Express** Best describe as a quick chart-generating Libary, which has a preset of defined charts from graph objects. All charts created by express, can also be created by graph objects but it might be a bit more stressful with more lines of code to obtain the preset features already covered within Plotly express.

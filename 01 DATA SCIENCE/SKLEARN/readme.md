# Machine Learning with Sklearn

## 1) Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning means we give the algorithm a training dataset which contains multiple variables __and the corrensponding outcomes__. With these variables and outcomes, the algorithm can build a mathematical equation that fits the best and reproduces the outcomes. When the model is built, we can then use it on new variables and the model will give predictions.

### 1.1) Regression
We use regression when we want to build a model that predicts numeric outcomes. For example: sales or attendance predictions.  

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Neural Networks

### 1.2) Classification
Classification means that we want to predict a result, that has __two outcomes True/False__. Some examples would be Students passing a Test or Image detection, where we basically want to say if the outcome is True or False.

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forests
* SVM
* Naive Bayes
* Neural Networks

## 2) Unsupervised Learning
### 2.1) Clustering
Unsupervised Learning means we __don't have a result/outcome__, so we can't give the algorithm a dataset which what the result should look like. Here we try to build clusters/groups that seem to fit together based on multiple variables. If the model is built we then can enter a new Datapoint and the algorithm will put the datapoint into one of the clusters/groups.

* k-means
* k-nearest Neighbors
* PCA

# Backend

This folder will contain some basic snippets for Java, Javascript and Python. I will keep each code example as short as possible, so it only shows the basic usage 
of the given framework and not going into detail or splitting files into MVC structure, because it would then get difficult to quickly lookup things when coming back
and needing to dig through 4-5 files each.   <br>

I will start with the biggest most known frameworks like Flask, Django, Express, Spring Boot and then maybe add some other alternatives in later (Fast-API, Fastify, Nextjs for example).
